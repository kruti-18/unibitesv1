# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, are dedicated to fostering an inclusive and respectful community environment. We strive to create a space that is free from harassment for everyone, regardless of various factors such as age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to engage in actions and interactions that promote an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards others
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Offering and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
